                I live in Voorhout, The Netherlands. I did one year of a graphic design course, but it wasn't the right fit for me.
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope to become a game developer, and my dream is to start or work for an indie studio.</p>

                <p>I live in Voorhout, a small town near Leiden. The school is in Amsterdam, so I have to take a train. 
                It takes me about an hour to get from home to school.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Voorhout is a nice little town, very friendly and reasonably quiet.
                However, I prefer to do my shopping in Sassenheim, one town over, because I grew up there.</p>

                <p>I'm a very creative person. I enjoy writing and drawing, and I love to read as well.
                I write fanfiction of my favorite shows that I post online.
